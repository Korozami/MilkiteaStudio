                        <p>Hello! I'm Sena, the creator of milkiteastudios, and I am here to share my art + my love for creating.

                        Floating somewhere between cute and unsettling, my current work involves bunnies in strange, dream-like worlds, along with other funky things. Besides my digital illustration work, I also make handmade items that reps my current obsession with making shy bunnies.

                        Come along on my creative journey! I'm on Instagram and YouTube @milkiteastudios</p>
